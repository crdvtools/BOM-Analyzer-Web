# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1 — CREATE THE GITHUB REPOSITORY
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Go to https://github.com/crdvtools
2. Click the green "New" button (or + icon top right → "New repository")
3. Fill in:
     Repository name:  bom-analyzer-web
     Description:      Open-source PCB BOM supply chain optimizer with AI insights
     Visibility:       ✅ Public (required for open source + free Streamlit hosting)
     Initialize:       ✅ Check "Add a README file" (we will replace it)
     Add .gitignore:   Python
     License:          ← Select "MIT License" (GitHub will generate a basic one,
                         but we will replace it with our custom version below)
4. Click "Create repository"


STEP 2 — UPLOAD YOUR FILES
───────────────────────────
You have 5 files to upload:

  app.py               ← Main application (the Streamlit web app)
  requirements.txt     ← Python dependencies
  README.md            ← This professional README (replace the generated one)
  LICENSE              ← MIT License with proper attribution (replace generated)
  CONTRIBUTING.md      ← Contributor guidelines
  .streamlit/
    config.toml        ← Theme config (must be inside a folder named .streamlit)

To upload:
1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file" (or "Add file" → "Upload files")
2. Drag and drop all files above
3. For config.toml: GitHub file upload does NOT support nested folders well.
   Use this method instead:
   a. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   b. In the Name field, type:  .streamlit/config.toml
   c. Paste the contents of config.toml into the editor
   d. Click "Commit new file"
4. For the README.md and LICENSE: overwrite the auto-generated versions

Commit message suggestion:
  "Initial release: BOM Analyzer Web v1.0.0"


STEP 3 — CREATE A RELEASE TAG
──────────────────────────────
1. In your repository, click "Releases" (right sidebar) → "Create a new release"
2. Click "Choose a tag" → type:  v1.0.0  → click "Create new tag: v1.0.0"
3. Release title:   BOM Analyzer Web v1.0.0
4. Description:
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 4 — DEPLOY ON STREAMLIT (FREE HOSTING)
────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select:
     Repository:  crdvtools/bom-analyzer-web
     Branch:      main
     Main file:   app.py
5. Click "Deploy!"
6. Your app will be live at a URL like:
     https://crdvtools-bom-analyzer-web-app-xxxxxx.streamlit.app
7. Share this URL with your PCB team


STEP 5 — RECOMMENDED REPOSITORY SETTINGS
──────────────────────────────────────────
In your repo, go to Settings:

• About (top right gear icon on repo home):
    Description:  Open-source PCB BOM supply chain optimizer with AI insights
    Website:      [paste your Streamlit URL once deployed]
    Topics:       pcb, bom, supply-chain, streamlit, electronics, procurement,
                  python, open-source, mouser, octopart

• Issues: Enable (allows community bug reports)
• Discussions: Enable (allows feature requests and Q&A)
• Wiki: Optional


STEP 6 — ADD A REPOSITORY BANNER (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Consider adding a screenshot of the app to the README.
After deploying on Streamlit:
1. Take a screenshot of the dashboard showing results
2. Save it as docs/screenshot.png or similar
3. Add to your repo and reference it in README.md:
   ![BOM Analyzer Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

LICENSE CHOICE RATIONALE — WHY MIT?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MIT License was chosen because:

✅ It's the most widely used open source license (#1 by usage in 2024)
✅ It matches the license used by the original BOM Analyzer desktop app
   (Tyler Allen's work), ensuring license compatibility for our derivative work
✅ It allows anyone (individuals, companies, other teams) to freely use,
   modify, and redistribute the tool — maximizing adoption in the PCB community
✅ It has no "copyleft" requirement — teams can use this in commercial settings
   without being required to open-source their internal BOMs or configurations
✅ Simple and clear — only 3 paragraphs, recognized worldwide

AGPL-3.0 was considered but rejected because it would require any organization
running this as a web service to publish their own source code — this creates
friction for PCB teams who may want to customize without open-sourcing.

GPL was similarly rejected for derivative commercial use concerns.

MIT is the right choice for a community tool in this domain.
